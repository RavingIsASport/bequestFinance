### Idea behind the system
My name is Gustavo Garcia. This system was designed to register or log users in and allow them to add data. Only the user logged in can add, update, and delete data. 
This is only the backend but a frontend is able to be incorporated. JsonWebToken protects the routes so only users can access and update or delete their data. Bcrypt is used to hash and verify passwords.
### Technologies
*  NodeJS for runtime
*  Express handles the routes
*  Bcrypt to hash passwords
*  JSONWebToken to protect routes and authenticate
*  MongoDB and Mongoose for the database and ODM
*  Dotenv for enviorment variables
